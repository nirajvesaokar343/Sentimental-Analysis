# Sentimental-Analysis
This research project aims to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews of Amazon Alexa products using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. In this study, we explore the application of machine learning algorithms to classify customer reviews of Amazon Alexa products into positive and negative sentiments. We use a dataset of customer reviews and employ a Random Forest Classifier to build a sentiment analysis model. The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.![image](https://github.com/nirajvesaokar343/Sentimental-Analysis/assets/113465384/81ca6d90-9a90-47a9-8ae8-b2e803bbf90b)
